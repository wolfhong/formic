    particular directory, caching inheritable Pattern matches.

    This is an internal implementation class and not meant for reuse
    or to be accessed directly

    **Implementation notes:**

    As the FileSet traverses the directories using, by default,
    :func:`os.walk()`, it builds two graphs of FileSetState instances mirroring
    the graph of directories - one graph of FileSetState instances is for the
    **include** globs and the other graph of FileSetState instances for the
    **exclude**.

    FileSetState embodies logic to decide whether to prune whole
    directories from the search, either by detecting the include patterns
    cannot match any file within, or by detecting that an exclude
    matches all files in this directory and sub-directories.

    The constructor has the following arguments:

    1. *label*: A string used only in the :meth:`__str__` method (for debugging)
    2. *directory*: The point in the graph that this FileSetState represents.
       *directory* is relative to the starting node of the graph
    3. *based_on*: A FileSetState from the previous directory traversed by
       `walk_func()`. This is used as the start point in the graph of
       FileSetStates to search for the correct parent of this. This is None
       to create the root node.
    4. *unmatched*: Used only when *based_on* is None  - the set of initial
       :class:`Pattern` instances. This is either the original include
       or exclude globs.

    During the construction of the instance, the instance will evaluate the
    directory patterns in :class:`PatternSet` ``self.unmatched`` and, for
    each :class:`Pattern`, perform of of the following actions:

    1. If a pattern matches, it will be moved into one of the 'matched'
    :class:`PatternSet` instances:

       a. ``self.matched_inherit``: the directory pattern matches all sub
          subdirectories as well, eg ``/test/**``
       b. ``self.matched_and_subdir``: the directory matches this directory
          and *may* match subdirectories as well, eg ``/test/**/more/**``
       c. ``self.matched_no_subdir``: the directory matches this directory,
          **but** cannot match any subdirectory, eg ``/test/*``. This pattern
          will thus not be evaluated in any subdirectory.

    2. If the pattern does not match, either:

       a. It may be valid in subdirectories, so it stays in ``self.unmatched``,
          eg ``**/nomatch/*``
       b. It cannot evaluate to true in any subdirectory, eg ``/nomatch/**``.
          In this case it is removed from all :class:`PatternSet` members
          in this instance.

class FileSet(object):
    """An implementation of the Ant FileSet class.

    Arguments to the constructor:

    1. *include*: An Ant glob or list of Ant globs for matching files to include
       in the response. Ant globs can be specified either:

       a. As a string, eg ``"*.py"``, or
       b. As a :class:`Pattern` object

    2. *exclude*: Specified in the same was as *include*, but any file that
       matches an exclude glob will be excluded from the result.
    3. *directory*: The directory from which to start the search; if None,
       the current working directory is used
    4. *default_excludes*: A boolean; if True (or omitted) the
       :attr:`DEFAULT_EXCLUDES` will be combined with the *exclude*.
       If False, the only excludes used are those in the excludes argument
    5. *symlinks*: Sets whether symbolic links are included in the results or not. Defaults to True.
    6. *walk*: A function whose argument is a single directory that returns
       a list of (dirname, subdirectoryNames, fileNames) tuples with the same
       semantics of :func:`os.walk()`. Defaults to :func:`os.walk()`
    7. *casesensitive*: Only effective on POSIX, default True. Always False on NT.

    Implementation notes:

    * :class:`FileSet` is lazy: The files in the :class:`FileSet` are resolved
      at the time the iterator is looped over. This means that it is very fast
      to set up and (can be) computationally expensive only when results are
      obtained.

    * You can iterate over the same :class:`FileSet` instance as many times
      as you want. Because the results are computed as you iterate over the
      object, each separate iteration can return different results, eg if the
      file system has changed.

    * *include* and *exclude* arguments to the constructor can be given in
      several ways:

      * A string: This will be automatically turned into a :class:`Pattern`
      * A :class:`Pattern`: If you prefer to construct the pattern yourself
      * A list of strings and/or :class:`Pattern` instances (as above)

    * In addition to Apache Ant's default excludes, :class:`FileSet` excludes:

      * ``__pycache__``

    * You can modify the :attr:`DEFAULT_EXCLUDES` class member (it is a list of
      :class:`Pattern` instances). Doing so will modify the behaviour of all
      instances of :class:`FileSet` using default excludes.

    * You can provide and alternate function to :func:`os.walk()` that, for
      example, heavily truncates the files and directories being searched or
      returns files and directories that don't even exist on the file system.
      This can be useful for testing or even for passing the results of one
      FileSet result as the search path of a second. See
      :func:`formic.treewalk.walk_from_list()`::

          files = ["CVS/error.py", "silly/silly1.txt", "1/2/3.py", "silly/silly3.txt", "1/2/4.py", "silly/silly3.txt"]
          fileset = FileSet(include="*.py", walk=treewalk.walk_from_list(files))
          for dir, file in fileset:
              print dir, file

       This lists 1/2/3.py and 1/2/4.py no matter what the contents of the
       current directory are. CVS/error.py is not listed because of the default
       excludes.
